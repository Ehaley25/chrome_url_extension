I got the idea from a course I took at scrimba; the idea was to create something "we" can use in the real world.
We built a chrome extension that uses local storage to save URLs from potential candidate's LinkedIn, twitter, etc.
The extension allows you to save your current tab with the click of a button, type in your own URL, and even delete the list you created once you figure you're done with it.

One cool thing Iâ€™d like to share is that I like to save resources I found online to the extension so that I have easy access later!
